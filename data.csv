Raoh; (ラオウ, Raō), also known by his alias Ken-Oh (拳王, The King of Fists), is one of the inheritors and practitioners of Hokuto Shinken. Unlike his brother Toki, who used his fist to heal the sick, or Kenshiro, who used his fist to protect the innocent, Raoh chose to become the most powerful martial artist of all time, and used his fist to become a mighty conqueror of the wasteland, subduing all people in his wake. Raoh is among the most fearsome combatants the wasteland has ever seen. He is rivalled only by Kenshiro, Toki (at his peak health), and Kaioh (whom prophecy claimed Raoh would ultimately defeat).;1.png
Yuria;  (ユリア, Yuria) is a major character in most incarnations of the Hokuto no Ken metaseries and the main character of her own single-volume spin-off manga, Yuria Gaiden: Jibo no Hoshi by Akimi Kasai. She is first introduced as the missing fiancée of main protagonist Kenshirō who was taken away from him by a jealous rival.;2.png
Jagi; (ジャギ) was the second youngest of the four Hokuto brothers, he was looked down on for his dirty tactics which demanded victory at any cost, such as relying on a shotgun or spitting needles. His desire to cheat was only rivaled by his contempt for Kenshiro, his younger adopted brother. Jagi believed that siblings must respect their elders and that it would be unforgivable for a younger brother to surpass him.;3.png
Shin;  (シン) is the successor of Nanto Koshū Ken (南斗孤鷲拳, "South Dipper Lone Eagle Fist"), one of the martial art styles within the Nanto Rokusei Ken. He bears the destiny of the Star of Martyrdom (殉星 Junsei), who is destined to live and die for love.;4.png
Souther; Souther is the sole successor of the Nanto Hōō Ken (南斗鳳凰拳, "South Dipper Phoenix Fist) style and one of the Nanto Roku Sei Ken. He bears the destiny of the Star of Leadership (将星 Shōsei), also known as the Polar Star (極星 Kyokusei) and Star of the Southern Cross (南十字星 Minami Jūji Sei). The Star of Leadership rules over the Nanto constellation and therefore none of the other Nanto successors can defeat him.;5.png
Toki; Toki (トキ, Toki) is the second of the four Hokuto brothers, Toki is a pacifist who seeks to use Hokuto Shinken as a healing art. Toki's self-made technique of Hokuto Ujō Ken (北斗有情拳, "Big Dipper Humane Fist") is adept at both healing and destroying. When using this style, his adversaries experience intense ecstasy before their deaths, instead of horrifying pain. According to Kenshiro, Toki had the most elegant style of the four brothers and was the ideal successor to Hokuto Shinken before his illness.;6.png
