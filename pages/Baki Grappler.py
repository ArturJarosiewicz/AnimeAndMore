I'm still wathing this series so maybe there will be an update in future. For now i really like that story. It is
focused on young(13 y.o!) boy named Baki Hanma who wanna be the strongest, most skilled fighter on earth.
Interesting thing in this story is that main antagonist is Baki's father Yujiro Hanama. Owner of the best physice of 
all anime i've ever seen, specially the back muscles
"""

content2 = """
Plot is simple but it dont boder me. We can find here old scheme from zero to hero.
The center of anime is fighting which is really cool in it. Baki defeats increasingly stronger opponents on his way.
My fav for now is huge, silent and incedibly strong yakuza mob Hanayama.
"""

content3 = """
If you like action fighting anime like dragon ball you have to watch Baki.
